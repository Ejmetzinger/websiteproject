		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<h3>I have many hobbies, I really like to go and find old computers and then put some hardware from the same era that it was from into it and see it play old games. I also collect old computers, I have a Texas Instruments 99-4a, and 2 iMac G3's.  I also collect knives this is my main hobby, there are so many tyoes of knives and they all have their own purpose and function. I have some pocket knife like kives, some assisted blades and a Swedish bayonet from 1896. I am also starting to get into knife making, I think that it would be cool to make the things that I love.  <img src = "https://bueker-gmbh.de/pics/l/alias3/B02-swedish-original-mauser-bayonet-m-1896.jpg" style = "width:400" title = "Mauser Bayonet"><h3>
